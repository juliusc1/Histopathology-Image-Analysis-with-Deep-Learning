# Histopathology Image Analysis with Deep Learning

This project applies deep learning techniques to classify histopathology images, aiming to distinguish between cancerous and non-cancerous tissue.  
The full analysis was developed and run in Google Colab.  
A complete project report (including figures and discussion) is included in this repository.

## Overview

- **Goal:** Build a deep learning model to classify histopathology images.
- **Approach:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) / (update with your actual model).
- **Environment:** Google Colab (Python, deep learning frameworks).
- **Output:** Training results, classification metrics, and analysis documented in the report.
